## üöÄ **TRAVERSAL PATTERNS**

### **Pattern 1: Breadth-First Search**
```cypher
// Explore all components within 2 hops of AccountHandler
MATCH (start:ApexClass {name: 'AccountHandler'})
CALL apoc.path.expand(start, null, null, 1, 2) YIELD path
RETURN path
```

### **Pattern 2: Depth-First Search**
```cypher
// Deep dependency chain exploration
MATCH path = (start:ApexClass {name: 'AccountHandler'})-[*1..5]->(end)
RETURN path
ORDER BY length(path) DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### **Pattern 3: Shortest Path**
```cypher
// Find shortest path between two components
MATCH (start:ApexClass {name: 'AccountTrigger'}),
      (end:CustomObject {name: 'Account'})
MATCH path = shortestPath((start)-[*]-(end))
RETURN path
```

## üìä **VISUALIZATION TIPS**

### **For Neo4j Browser:**
1. **Limit Results**: Always use `LIMIT` for large datasets
2. **Color Coding**: Different node types get different colors
3. **Expand Nodes**: Click nodes to see more relationships
4. **Save Queries**: Use favorites for common queries

### **For Custom Visualization:**
```cypher
// Export data for external visualization
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)
RETURN n.name as source, 
       type(r) as relationship, 
       m.name as target,
       labels(n) as sourceType,
       labels(m) as targetType
```

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Start with Basic Queries**: Begin with overview queries
2. **Explore Your Data**: Use the Account ecosystem query
3. **Analyze Dependencies**: Focus on class and trigger relationships
4. **Build Custom Queries**: Modify examples for your specific needs
5. **Create Dashboards**: Use results to build monitoring dashboards

Your Salesforce metadata graph is now ready for comprehensive exploration! üéâ
