## 📊 **STEP 6: Load Your Salesforce Data**

Once Neo4j Browser is working, go back to your command prompt:

# Load your 199 relationships into Neo4j
python neo4j_loader.py
```

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If Neo4j Desktop won't start:**
- Wait 2-3 minutes (it can be slow on first startup)
- Check Windows Task Manager for "Neo4j Desktop" process
- Restart as administrator if needed

### **If database won't start:**
- Check that no other Neo4j instances are running
- Try creating a new database with different name
- Restart Neo4j Desktop

### **If browser won't connect:**
- Make sure database status is "Active"
- Try http://127.0.0.1:7474 instead
- Check Windows Firewall settings

### **If data loader fails:**
- Verify Neo4j Browser is accessible
- Check password in neo4j_loader.py matches your database password
- Run: `python test_neo4j_connection.py`
